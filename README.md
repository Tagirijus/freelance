A programm for managing clients, projects and connected offers and invoices.

# In detail

The programm is meant to help self-employed freelancers with their project management. You can have a list of clients with metadata, connected projects to the clients with metadata and also offers and invoices connected to the projects. The offer module can have entries, which will calculate prices automatically - the invoice module is similar. In the end you can even export offers and invoices to open office format.

The frontend is made with my tweaked version of [npyscreen](https://github.com/Tagirijus/npyscreen/tree/NotifyInput).

# Installation

To be honest: totally helpless here. I have installed my tweaked version of `npyscreen` in the system and my freelance script in my folder, which I start with `python3 run.py`, when in the folder (I made some shortcuts, of course). This is probably totally noob-alike. Maybe somebody is going to improve it some day?

# Usage

Start the programm and open the menu with `Ctrl+X`. Then you have a help option for nearly every form of the progamm, which should help you.

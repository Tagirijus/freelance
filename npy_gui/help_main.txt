This programm is for managing clients and their projects as a freelancer. For now you can assign offers to a project. Later it will also be possible to add invoices as well. Maybe even a linked system to ledger cli timetracking data, which will generate an invoice based on time tracking.


General shortcuts:

-> Ctrl+X: brings up the menu
-> Ctrl+Q: cancel button (Q for "quit")
-> Ctrl+O: ok button (O for "ok")


Client list / Project list:

-> INS: create a new client / project, depending on the selected list
-> DEL: deactivate ("delete") the selected client / project
-> ENTER: edit the selected client / project


In the settings you can set up default texts and other settings. There are possible string replacements in the defaults and also in the most string inputs. For example you can set up a project name like "{YEAR}-{MONTH} " and when this becomes a preset, it will (e.g. on the 15th of octobre 1987) become "1987-10 " automatically. Just try these string replacement variables:

- {YEAR}: replaces with the year of the offer
- {MONTH}: replaces with the month of the offer
- {DAY}: replaces with the day of the offer
- {PROJECT_TITLE}: replaces with the project title of the connected project
- {PROJECT_OFFER_COUNT}: replace with the count + 1 of offers for this project
- {CLIENT_...}: replaces with the connected clients ..., possible entries:
	CLIENT_COMPANY, _SALUT, _NAME,
	_FAMILY, _FULLNAME, _STREET,
	_POST_CODE,	_CITY, _TAX_ID


Hope this programm will help some freelancers out there! (:

This programm is for managing clients and their projects as a freelancer. For now you can assign offers to a project. Later it will also be possible to add invoices as well. Maybe even a linked system to ledger cli timetracking data, which will generate an invoice based on time tracking.


General shortcuts:

-> Ctrl+X: brings up the menu
-> Ctrl+Q: cancel button (Q for "quit")
-> Ctrl+O: ok button (O for "ok")


Client list / Project list:

-> INS: create a new client / project, depending on the selected list
-> DEL: deactivate ("delete") the selected client / project
-> ENTER: edit the selected client / project


In the settings you can set up default texts and other settings. There are possible string replacements in the defaults and also in the most string inputs. For example you can set up a project name like "{YEAR}-{MONTH} " and when this becomes a preset, it will (e.g. on the 15th of octobre 1987) become "1987-10 " automatically. Just try these string replacement variables:

Global:
- {YEAR}: replaces with the year of the offer
- {MONTH}: replaces with the month of the offer
- {DAY}: replaces with the day of the offer
- {CLIENT_COUNT}: count of all clients (also inactive!)
- {PROJECT_COUNT}: count of all projects (also inactive!)
- {OFFER_COUNT}: count of all offers (also inactive!)
- {INVOICE_COUNT}: count of all invoices (also inactive!)
- {INVOICE_COUNT_B}: tries to get the highest to integer convertable invoice id + 1

Project:
- {PROJECT_TITLE}: replaces with the project title of the connected project
- {PROJECT_OFFER_COUNT}: replace with the count + 1 of offers for this project
- {PROJECT_INVOICE_COUNT}: replace with the count + 1 of offers for this project

Client:
- {CLIENT_...}: replaces with the connected clients ..., possible entries:
	CLIENT_COMPANY, _ATTN, _SALUT,
	_NAME, _FAMILY, _FULLNAME, _STREET,
	_POST_CODE,	_CITY, _COUNTRY, _TAX_ID

Offer / invcoie:
- {TITLE}: title
- {COMMENT}: comment
- {COMMENT_B}: comment b
- {DATE}: date
- {DELIVERY}: delivery string
- {DUE_DATE}: due date
- {FINISH_DATE}: finishing date (mainly used in an offer)
- {TIME_TOTAL}: total working time
- {COMMODITY}: the commodity
- {WAGE}: the hourly wage
- {PRICE_TOTAL}: the total price without tax
- {TAX_TOTAL}: the total tax only price
- {PRICE_TAX_TOTAL}: the total price + tax
- {HAS_TAX}: boolen if any tax exists

Entries:
These are keys for dictionary variables, which you can access inside the template via entries['KEY'].
- {POSITION}: position of the entry
- {TITLE}: title of the entry
- {COMMENT}: its comment
- {TIME}: its time
- {AMOUNT}: its amount returned with the amount format string
- {PRICE}: its price without tax
- {UNIT_PRICE}: its price not multiplied by its amount
- {PRICE_TAX}: its price tax only
- {UNIT_PRICE_TAX}: its price tax only not multiplied by its amount
- {TOTAL}: price with tax
- {UNIT_TOTAL}: price with tax not multiplied by its amount
- {TAX_PERCENT}: the tax percentage as a number
- {HAS_TAX}: boolean; true if entry has a tax percentage or value > 0


You can use replacements in the defaults as well. Write it like {#...} and it will be replaced in a new offer / invoice for example as {...} and only later replaced on export.


Hope this programm will help some freelancers out there! (:

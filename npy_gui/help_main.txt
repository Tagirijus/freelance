This programm is for managing clients and their projects as a freelancer. For now you can assign offers to a project. Later it will also be possible to add invoices as well. Maybe even a linked system to ledger cli timetracking data, which will generate an invoice based on time tracking.


General shortcuts:

-> Ctrl+X: brings up the menu
-> Ctrl+Q: cancel button (Q for "quit")
-> Ctrl+O: ok button (O for "ok")


Client list / Project list:

-> INS: create a new client / project, depending on the selected list
-> DEL: deactivate ("delete") the selected client / project
-> ENTER: edit the selected client / project


In the settings you can set up default texts and other settings.

Hope this programm will help some freelancers out there! (:

Data path:
The path, which should direct to a folder for storing this programms settings and all the clients and projects database.


Inactive dir:
The subfolder inside clients or projects folder inside the data_path holding the inactive ("deleted") data. A data structure could look like this:

data_path/ -> settings and defaults
data_path/clients/ -> client data
data_path/clients/inactive -> inactive/deleted client data
data_path/projects/ -> project data
data_path/projects/inactive -> inactive/deleted project data


Defaults:
A list of default packs. Generally it is meant to hold default texts etc. in  differnet language per "pack".

-> INS: create a new pack
-> DEL: delete (no revert!!) a pack
-> ENTER: edit the selected pack


Default language:
Choose which default language should be used, when creating new stuff.


Offer count offset:
Set the offset for counting the offers (in case you had another database, but do not want to count from 0 again).


Ledgeradd command:
Command for the command line to start ledgeradd programm.


Ledgeradd account:
The receiving account for the ledgeradd integration. See "Ledger alias file" below for more information about the ledgeradd formatting.


Ledgeradd tax account:
The sub account holding the tax, the client paid.


Ledger alias file & ledger alias default account:
The file with only the aliases for the ledger journal. The ledgeradd command adds transactions to the journal in this format:

	1987-10-15 * (100) Project title here
	 [CLIENT_ID]:Entry or single account  $ 500,00
	 [ledgeradd receiving account]

[CLIENT_ID] will be replaced by the clients id. Thus you could need an alias in your ledger journal to replace such a client ID with something more specific. Such an alias could look like this in your ledger journal:

	alias PCJD01=Income:Clients:Pattern Company:John Doe

The middle part is the "Ledger alias default account" here. You can make this dynamic as well. The above example default account string could look like this, when dynamic:

	Income:Clients:{CLIENT_COMPANY}:{CLIENT_FULLNAME}

It's just a default string. When running the ledger alias command in the client form you will still be asked what string exactly you would like to be added.

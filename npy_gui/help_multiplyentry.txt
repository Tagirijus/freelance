A multiply entry calculates the estimated time and thus a price for a task, based on a hourly rate. Basically it's a multiplication:


hourly rate * amount = time
wage add = wage added to the hourly input wage
wage add explain = explanation of the amount added to the wage

and then

time * (wage + wage_add) = price


Amount format has replacement values like this:

- {s}: standard automatic amount
- {d}: amount in decimal
- {F}: amount converted to time, show full
- {R}: amount converted to time, show remaining


Title / comment has replacement values like this:

- {E_POSITION}: position of the entry
- {E_TITLE}: title of the entry
- {E_COMMENT}: its comment
- {E_TIME}: its time
- {E_QUANTITY}: its amount returned with the amount format string
- {E_QUANTITY_B}: its amount B returned with the amount format string
- {E_PRICE}: its price without tax
- {E_UNIT_PRICE}: its price not multiplied by its amount
- {E_PRICE_TAX}: its price tax only
- {E_UNIT_PRICE_TAX}: its price tax only not multiplied by its amount
- {E_TOTAL}: price with tax
- {E_UNIT_TOTAL}: price with tax not multiplied by its amount

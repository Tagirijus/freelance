A multiply entry calculates the estimated time and thus a price for a task, based on a hourly rate. Basically it's a multiplication:


hourly rate * amount = time

and then

time * wage = price


Amount format has replacement values like this:

- {s}: standard automatic amount
- {d}: amount in decimal
- {F}: amount converted to time, show full
- {R}: amount converted to time, show remaining


You can also load a preset from the menu.

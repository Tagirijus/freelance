Date / due date / paid date:
Choose a date form the date box. If paid date is not set, the invoice is tagged as "not paid" and will be listed in the unpaid invoices list from the main menu.

Following options are possible, when you save an invoice as a preset with the following dates, where s_date stands for the date you saved to the preset and l_date stands for the date, which will "come from the preset" then.

- s_date = None --> l_date = actual date
- s_date = set --> l_date = the set date
- s_due_date = None --> l_due_date = l_date + settigns due_days
- s_due_date = set --> l_due_date = l_due_date
- s_paid_date = None --> l_paid_date = None
- s_paid_date = set
	--> option A: l_paid_date = l_date, when s_date was None
	--> option B: l_paid_date = s_paid_date, when s_date was set

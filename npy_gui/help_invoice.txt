Title:
The title of the invoice.


ID:
The ID / number for the invoice.


Date / due date / paid date:
Choose a date form the date box. If paid date is not set, the invoice is tagged as "not paid" and will be listed in the unpaid invoices list from the main menu.

Following options are possible, when you save an invoice as a preset with the following dates, where s_date stands for the date you saved to the preset and l_date stands for the date, which will "come from the preset" then.

- s_date = None --> l_date = None
- s_date = set --> l_date = today
- s_due_date = None --> l_due_date = None
- s_due_date = set --> l_due_date = l_date + settings due_days
- s_paid_date = None --> l_paid_date = None
- s_paid_date = set --> l_paid_date = l_date

On replacing strings the None-dates will be replaced by actual dates. This way you can save up a preset with None-dates, which you can replace at once with the replace function on another day (in case you are filling an invoice over time and do not want the creation day of the invoice to be the actual invoice date).


Date fmt:
Possible formating options are:

- %Y: year
- %m: month
- %d: day

Example:
"%Y-%m on the %d. day" -> e.g. "2017-05 on the 07. day"


Wage:
Enter an individual wage for this offer. If this is set to 0, the projects wage will be used.


Round price:
If enabled the prices will be rounded to a non-decimal number.


You can also load a preset from the menu.
